**PettingZoo is a simple, pythonic interface capable of representing general multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems.**
PettingZoo includes a wide variety of reference environments, helpful utilities, and tools for creating your own custom environments.

The [AEC API](/api/aec/) supports sequential turn based environments, while the [Parallel API](/api/parallel/) supports environments with simultaneous actions.

Environments can be interacted with using a similar interface to [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org):

```python
  from pettingzoo.butterfly import knights_archers_zombies_v10
  env = knights_archers_zombies_v10.env(render_mode="human")
  env.reset(seed=42)
  for agent in env.agent_iter():
      observation, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()
      action = policy(observation, agent)
      env.step(action)
```
