# Development Documentation

So you've decided you want to create your own PettingZoo environment. Congratulations! Here are two pieces of documentation that are hopefully helpful:

## Template Environment
Creating a custom environment with PettingZoo should roughly look like the following:

```
from pettingzoo import AECEnv
from pettingzoo.utils import agent_selector
from gym import spaces


class env(AECEnv):
    metadata = {'render.modes': ['human']} # only add if environment supports rendering

    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
        super(env, self).__init__()

        self.agents = [0, 1 ... n] # agent names
        self.agent_order = # list of agent names in the order they act in a cycle. Usually this will be the same as the agents list.
        self.observation_spaces = # dict of observation spaces for each agent, from gym.spaces
        self.action_spaces = # dict of action spaces for each agent, from gym.spaces
        self.rewards = {0:[first agent's reward], 1:[second agent's reward] ... n-1:[nth agent's reward]}
        self.dones = {0:[first agent's done state], 1:[second agent's done state] ... n-1:[nth agent's done state]}
        self.infos = {0:[first agent's info], 1:[second agent's info] ... n-1:[nth agent's info]}

        # agent selection stuff
        self._agent_selector = agent_selector(self.agent_order)
        
        self.num_agents = len(self.agents)

        # Initialize game stuff

    def observe(self, agent):
        # return observation of an agent
        return observation

    def step(self, action, observe=True):
        # Do game stuff on the selected agent

        # Switch selection to next agents
        self.agent_selection = self._agent_selector.next()

        if observe:
            return self.observe(self.agent_selection)
        else:
            return

    # last is added as a part of the AECEnv class, don't write it yourself

    def reset(self, observe=True):
        # reset environment

        # selects the first agent
        self._agent_selector.reinit(self.agent_order)
        self.agent_selection = self._agent_selector.next()
        if observe:
            return self.observe(self.agent_selection)
        else:
            return

    def render(self, mode='human'): # not all environments will support rendering
        ...

    def close(self):
        ...
```

## Agent selector 

`from pettingzoo.utils.agent_selector import agent_selector`

The agent selector class (along with the agent_order list in your environment) provides all the functionality that you should need to cycle through different agents in your environment without having to write it yourself. It's not part of the official API, but we highly encourage you to use it.

### Methods

`reset()`: Resets the agent selector object. It uses the `agent_order` list that is already present in the object. Returns the first agent id of the order as the selected agent.

`reinit(agent_order)`: If the agent order changes (for example, if a 'Reverse' card is played in Uno), reinitialize the agent selector object with the new `agent_order`. Does not return anything.

`next()`: Returns the id (say, _x_) of the next agent in the `agent_order`. Auto-increments the internal agent counter so that next time `next()` is called, id of the agent next to _x_ in the order is returned.

`is_last()`: Checks if the previous agent that was returned in the last agent in the `agent_order`. Returns True if yes, False otherwise. Note this method serves little purpose if the `agent_order` might change in the game.

### Usage in game environments

Import this class into your environment as `from pettingzoo.utils import agent_selector` at the top of the module.

Define an agent selector object in the env as `self._agent_selector = self.agent_selector(self.agent_order)`.

In `reset()` method of your env, do `self.agent_selection = self._agent_selector.reset()`.

If you want to select the next agent, do `self.agent_selection = self._agent_selector.next()`.

If the agent order ever changes, reinitialize the object as `self._agent_selector.reinit(self.agent_order)`.

Finally, for a static agent order, you can check if the previous agent id that was output by the selector is the last agent in the order, by performing a truth value check on `self._agent_selector.is_last()`.
