{% include info_box.md %}



In this environment a single agent sees a landmark position and is rewarded based on how close it gets to the landmark (Euclidian distance). This is not a multiagent environment, and is primarily intended for debugging purposes.

Observation space: `[self_vel, landmark_rel_position]`

### Arguments

```
simple_v2.env(max_cycles=25)
```



`max_cycles`:  number of frames (a step for each agent) until game terminates
