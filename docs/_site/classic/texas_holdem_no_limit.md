*AEC Diagram*

Texas Hold'em is a poker game involving 2 players and a regular 52 cards deck. At the beginning, both players get two cards. After betting, three community cards are shown and another round follows. At any time, a player could fold and the game will end. The winner will receive +1 as a reward and the loser will get -1. This is an implementation of the standard limitted version of Texas Hold'm, sometimes referred to as 'Limit Texas Hold'em'.

Our implementation wraps [RLCard](http://rlcard.org/games.html#limit-texas-hold-em) and you can refer to its documentation for additional details. Please cite their work if you use this game in research.

#### Observation Space

The observation space is a vector of 72 boolean integers. The first 52 entries depict the current player's hand plus any community cards as follows
