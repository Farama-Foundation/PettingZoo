# Third-Party Environments

*These environments are not maintained by Farama Foundation and, as such, cannot be guaranteed to function as intended.*

## Environments using the latest versions of PettingZoo
*Due to a very recent major release of PettingZoo, there are currently few contributed third-party environments. If you'd like to contribute one, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nHg2JRN489).*
