Connect Four is a 2-player turn based game, where players must connect four of their tokens vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The players drop their respective token in a column of a standing grid, where each token will fall until it reaches the bottom of the column or reaches an existing token. Players cannot place a token in a full column, and the game ends when either a player has made a sequence of 4 tokens, or when all 7 columns have been filled.

### Observation Space

The observation is a dictionary which contains an `'observation'` element which is the usual RL observation described below, and an  `'action_mask'` which holds the legal moves, described in the Legal Actions Mask section.


The main observation space is 2 planes of a 6x7 grid. Each plane represents a specific agent's tokens, and each location in the grid represents the placement of the corresponding agent's token. 1 indicates that the agent has a token placed in that cell, and 0 indicates they do not have a token in that cell. A 0 means that either the cell is empty, or the other agent has a token in that cell.


#### Legal Actions Mask

The legal moves available to the current agent are found in the `action_mask` element of the dictionary observation. The `action_mask` is a binary vector where each index of the vector represents whether the action is legal or not. The `action_mask` will be all zeros for any agent except the one whose turn it is. Taking an illegal move ends the game with a reward of -1 for the illegally moving agent and a reward of 0 for all other agents.


### Action Space

The action space is the set of integers from 0 to 6 (inclusive), where the action represents which column a token should be dropped in.

### Rewards

If an agent successfully connects four of their tokens, they will be rewarded 1 point. At the same time, the opponent agent will be awarded -1 points. If the game ends in a draw, both players are rewarded 0.


### Version History

* v3: Fixed bug in arbitrary calls to observe() (1.8.0)
* v2: Legal action mask in observation replaced illegal move list in infos (1.5.0)
* v1: Bumped version of all environments due to adoption of new agent iteration scheme where all agents are iterated over after they are done (1.4.0)
* v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
