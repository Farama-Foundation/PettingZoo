```

Classic two player competitive game of timing.

Get the ball past the opponent.

Scoring a point gives you +1 reward and your opponent -1 reward.

Serves are timed: If the player does not serve within 2 seconds of receiving the ball, they receive -1 points, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game, but also means it is no longer a purely zero sum game.
