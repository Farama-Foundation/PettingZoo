A competitive game of control.

Try to get the ball in your opponents hoop. But you cannot move on their side of the court. Scoring a point also gives your opponent -1 reward.

Serves are timed: If the player does not serve within 2 seconds of receiving the ball, they receive -1 points, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game, but also means it is no longer a purely zero sum game.
