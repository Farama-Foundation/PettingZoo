In this environment, bipedal robots attempt to carry a package as far right as possible. A package is placed on top of 3 (by default) bipedal robots which you control. A positive reward is awarded to each walker, which is the change in the package distance summed with 130 times the change in the walker's position. By default, the environment is done if any walker or the package falls. A walker is given a reward of -100 when they fail the game by either condition. If the walker falls, they are penalized an additional -10. If the `terminate_on_fall` setting is set to false, the game continues until the package falls. If the `remove_on_fall` setting is set to True, the walkers are removed from the scene after they fall. If the global reward mechanic is chosen, the mean of all rewards is given to each agent. Each walker exerts force on two joints in their two legs, giving a continuous action space represented as a 4 element vector. Each walker observes via a 31 element vector containing simulated noisy lidar data about the environment and information about neighboring walkers. The environment's duration is capped at 500 frames by default (can be controlled by the `max_cycles` setting).



### Observation Space

Each agent receives an observation composed of various physical properties of its legs and joints, as well as LIDAR readings from the space immediately in front and below the robot. The observation also includes information about neighboring walkers, and the package, which have normally distributed signal noise controlled by `position_noise` and `angle_noise`. For walkers without neighbors, observations about neighbor positions are zero.



This table enumerates the observation space:
