# Tianshou Tutorial

These tutorials provide an introduction to using [Tianshou](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou) with PettingZoo.

* [Basic API Usage](/tutorials/tianshou/beginner/): _View a game between random agents_

* [Training Agents](/tutorials/tianshou/intermediate): _Train a DQN agent_

* [CLI and Logging](/tutorials/tianshou/advanced): _Full training script with CLI and logging_

## Tianshou Overview

[Tianshou](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou) is a lightweight reinforcement learning platform providing fast-speed, modularized framework and pythonic API for building the deep reinforcement learning agent with the least number of lines of code.
It uses pure [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and is written in only ~4000 lines of code.

It boasts a large number of algorithms and high quality software engineering standards: thorough testing, type hints, and comprehensive documentation.
