*Combat*'s plane mode is an adversarial game where timing,
positioning, and keeping track of your opponent's complex
movements are key.

The players fly around the map, able to control flight direction
but not your speed.

When your opponent is hit by your bullet,
you score a point.

Whenever you score a point, you are rewarded +1 and your opponent is penalized -1.
