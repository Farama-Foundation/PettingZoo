A competitive game of memory and planning!

Its a race to leave the maze. There are 3 main versions of the game.

1. **Race**: A basic version of the game. First to leave the maze wins
2. **Robbers**: There are 2 robbers randomly traversing the maze. If you are captured by the robbers, you lose the game, and receive -1 reward, and will be done. The player that has not been captured will not receive any reward, but they can still exit the maze and win, scoring +1 reward.
3. **Capture**: Each player have to capture all 3 robbers before you are able to exit the maze. Additionally, you can confuse your opponent (and yourself, if you are not careful!) by creating a block that looks identical to a wall in the maze, but all players can pass through it. You can only create one wall at a time, when you create a new one, the old one disappears.

The first player to leave the maze scores +1, the other player scores -1 (unless that other player has already been captured in Robbers mode).

[Official Maze craze manual](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=295). Note that the table of modes has some inaccuracies. In particular, game mode 12 has Blockade enabled, not mode 11.
