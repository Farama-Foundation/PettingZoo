Competitive game of control and timing.

When you are on offense you must pass the puck between your two players (you control the one with the puck) to get it past your opponent's defense. On defense, you control the player directly in front of the puck. Both players must handle the rapid switches of control, while maneuvering around your opponent. If you score, you are rewarded +1, and your opponent -1.
