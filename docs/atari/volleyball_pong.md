Four player team battle.

Get the ball onto your opponent's floor to score. In addition to being able to move left and right, each player can also jump higher to affect the ball's motion above the net.

Scoring a point gives your team +1 reward and your opponent team -1 reward.

Serves are timed: If the player does not serve within 2 seconds of receiving the ball, their team receives -1 points, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game, but also means it is no longer a purely zero sum game.
