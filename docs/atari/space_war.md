*Space war* is an competitive game where prediction and positioning are key.

The players move around the map. When your opponent is hit by your bullet,
you score a point. The game is similar to combat, but with a more advanced physics system where acceleration and momentum need to be taken into account.

Whenever you score a point, you are rewarded +1 and your opponent is penalized -1.
