Four player team battle.

Get the ball past your opponent's defenders to the scoring area. Like traditional foozball, the board has alternating layers of paddles from each team between the goal areas. To succeed at this game, the two players on each side must coordinate to allow the ball to be passed between these layers up the board and into your opponent's scoring area.

Scoring a point gives your team +1 reward and your opponent's team -1 reward.

Serves are timed: If the player does not serve within 2 seconds of receiving the ball, their team receives -1 points, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game, but also means it is no longer a purely zero sum game.
