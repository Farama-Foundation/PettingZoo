An adversarial game that combines control and precise selection.

The game has two stages: selection and play. Selection can be
difficult because you have to hold the same action for a few steps and then
take the 0 action. Strategy choice is timed: if a player does not select any action after 2 seconds (120 frames)
then the player is rewarded -1, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game.

Once play begins, each team has two players. You only control
one at a time, and and which one you control depends on the selected play.
Scoring should be familiar to basketball fans (2-3 points per successful shot).
