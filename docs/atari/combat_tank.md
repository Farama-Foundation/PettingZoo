*Combat*'s classic tank mode is an adversarial game where prediction, and positioning are key.

The players move around the map. When your opponent is hit by your bullet,
you score a point. Note that your opponent gets blasted through obstacles when it is hit, potentially putting it in a good position to hit you back.

Whenever you score a point, you are rewarded +1 and your opponent is penalized -1.

#### Environment parameters

Some environment parameters are common to all Atari environments and are described in the [base Atari documentation](../atari).

Parameters specific to combat-tank are

```
combat_tank_v1.env(has_maze=False, is_invisible=False, billiard_hit=False)
```

`has_maze`:  Set to true to have the map be a maze instead of an open field

`is_invisible`:  If true, tanks are invisible unless they are firing or are running into a wall.

`billiard_hit`:  If true, bullets bounce off walls, in fact, like billiards, they only count if they hit the opponent's tank after bouncing off a wall.
