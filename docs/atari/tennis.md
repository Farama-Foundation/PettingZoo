A competitive game of positioning and prediction.

Goal: Get the ball past your opponent. Don't let the ball get past you.

When a point is scored (by the ball exiting the area), you get +1 reward and your opponent gets -1 reward. Unlike normal tennis matches, the number of games won is not directly rewarded.

Serves are timed: If the player does not serve within 3 seconds of receiving the ball, they receive -1 points, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game, but also means it is no longer a purely zero sum game.
