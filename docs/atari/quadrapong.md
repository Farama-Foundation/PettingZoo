Four player team battle.

Each player controls a paddle and defends a scoring area. However, this is a team game, and so two of the 4 scoring areas belong to the same team. So a given team must try to coordinate to get the ball away from their scoring areas towards their opponent's.
Specifically `first_0` and `third_0` are on one team and `second_0` and `fourth_0` are on the other.

Scoring a point gives your team +1 reward and your opponent team -1 reward.

Serves are timed: If the player does not serve within 2 seconds of receiving the ball, their team receives -1 points, and the timer resets. This prevents one player from indefinitely stalling the game, but also means it is no longer a purely zero sum game.
