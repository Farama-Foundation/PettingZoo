Mixed sum game involving scoring points in an unforgiving world. Careful positioning, timing,
and control is essential, as well as awareness of your opponent.

In Joust, you score points by hitting the opponent and NPCs when
you are above them. If you are below them, you lose a life.
In a game, there are a variety of waves with different enemies
and different point scoring systems. However, expect that you can earn
around 3000 points per wave.
