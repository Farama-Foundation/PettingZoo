## Initializing Environments

Using environments in PettingZoo is very similar to using them in OpenAI's Gym. You initialize an environment via:

``` python
from pettingzoo.butterfly import pistonball_v6
env = pistonball_v6.env()
```

Environments are generally highly configurable via arguments at creation, i.e.:

``` python
cooperative_pong.env(ball_speed=18, left_paddle_speed=25,
right_paddle_speed=25, is_cake_paddle=True, max_cycles=900, bounce_randomness=False)
```

## Interacting With Environments

Environments can be interacted with using a similar interface to Gym:

``` python
env.reset()
for agent in env.agent_iter():
    observation, reward, done, info = env.last()
    action = policy(observation, agent)
    env.step(action)
```

The commonly used methods are:

`agent_iter(max_iter=2**63)` returns an iterator that yields the current agent of the environment. It terminates when all agents in the environment are done or when `max_iter` (steps have been executed).

`last(observe=True)` returns observation, reward, done, and info for the agent currently able to act. The returned reward is the cumulative reward that the agent has received since it last acted. If `observe` is set to False, the observation will not be computed, and None will be returned in its place. Note that a single agent being done does not imply the environment is done.

`reset()` resets the environment and sets it up for use when called the first time.

`step(action)` takes and executes the action of the agent in the environment, automatically switches control to the next agent.

## Additional Environment API

PettingZoo models games as *Agent Environment Cycle* (AEC) games, and thus can support any game multi-agent RL can consider, allowing for fantastically weird cases. Because of this, our API includes lower level functions and attributes that you probably won't need but are very important when you do. Their functionality is used to implement the high-level functions above though, so including them is just a matter of code factoring.

`agents`: A list of the names of all current agents, typically integers. These may be changed as an environment progresses (i.e. agents can be added or removed).

`num_agents`: The length of the agents list.

`agent_selection` an attribute of the environment corresponding to the currently selected agent that an action can be taken for.

`observation_space(agent)` a function that retrieves the observation space for a particular agent. This space should never change for a particular agent ID.

`action_space(agent)` a function that retrieves the action space for a particular agent. This space should never change for a particular agent ID.

`dones`: A dict of the done state of every current agent at the time called, keyed by name. `last()` accesses this attribute. Note that agents can be added or removed from this dict. The returned dict looks like:

`dones = {0:[first agent's done state], 1:[second agent's done state] ... n-1:[nth agent's done state]}`

`infos`: A dict of info for each current agent, keyed by name. Each agent's info is also a dict. Note that agents can be added or removed from this attribute. `last()` accesses this attribute. The returned dict looks like:

`infos = {0:[first agent's info], 1:[second agent's info] ... n-1:[nth agent's info]}`

`observe(agent)`: Returns the observation an agent currently can make. `last()` calls this function.

`rewards`: A dict of the rewards of every current agent at the time called, keyed by name. Rewards the instantaneous reward generated after the last step. Note that agents can be added or removed from this attribute. `last()` does not directly access this attribute, rather the returned reward is stored in an internal variable. The rewards structure looks like:

`{0:[first agent's reward], 1:[second agent's reward] ... n-1:[nth agent's reward]}`

`seed(seed=None)`: Reseeds the environment. `reset()` must be called after `seed()`, and before `step()`.

`render(mode='human')`: Displays a rendered frame from the environment, if supported. Alternate render modes in the default environments are `'rgb_array'` which returns a numpy array and is supported by all environments outside of classic, and `'ansi'` which returns the strings printed (specific to classic environments).

`close()`: Closes the rendering window.

### Optional API Components

While not required by the base API, most downstream wrappers and utilities depend on the following attributes and methods, and they should be added to new environments except in special circumstances where adding one or more is not possible.

`possible_agents`: A list of all possible_agents the environment could generate. Equivalent to the list of agents in the observation and action spaces. This cannot be changed through play or resetting.

`max_num_agents`: The length of the possible_agents list.

`observation_spaces`: A dict of the observation spaces of every agent, keyed by name. This cannot be changed through play or resetting.

`action_spaces`: A dict of the action spaces of every agent, keyed by name. This cannot be changed through play or resetting.

`state()`: Returns a global observation of the current state of the environment. Not all environments will support this feature.

`state_space`: The space of a global observation of the environment. Not all environments will support this feature.

## Notable Idioms

### Checking if the entire environment is done

When an agent is done, it's removed from `agents`, so when the environments done `agents` will be an empty list. This means `not env.agents` is a simple condition for the environment being done

### Unwrapping an environment

If you have a wrapped environment, and you want to get the unwrapped environment underneath all the layers of wrappers (so that you can manually call a function or change some underlying aspect of the environment), you can use the `.unwrapped` attribute. If the environment is already a base environment, the `.unwrapped` attribute will just return itself.

``` python
base_env = prospector_v4.env().unwrapped
```

### Variable Numbers of Agents (Death)

Agents can die and generate during the course of an environment. If an agent dies, then its entry in the `dones` dictionary is set to `True`, it become the next selected agent (or after another agent that is also done), and the action it takes is required to be `None`. After this vacuous step is taken, the agent will be removed from `agents` and other changeable attributes. Agent generation can just be done with appending it to `agents` and the other changeable attributes (with it already being in the possible agents and action/observation spaces), and transitioning to it at some point with agent_iter.

### Environment as an Agent

In certain cases, separating agent from environment actions is helpful for studying. This can be done by treating the environment as an agent. We encourage calling the environment actor `env` in env.agents, and having it take `None` as an action.


## Raw Environments

Environments are by default wrapped in a handful of lightweight wrappers that handle error messages and ensure reasonable behavior given incorrect usage (i.e. playing illegal moves or stepping before resetting). However, these add a very small amount of overhead. If you want to create an environment without them, you can do so by using the `raw_env()` constructor contained within each module:

``` python
env = prospector_v4.raw_env(<environment parameters>)
```

## Parallel API

In addition to the main API, we have a secondary parallel API for environments where all agents have simultaneous actions and observations. An environment with parallel API support can be created via `<game>.parallel_env()`. This API is based around the paradigm of *Partially Observable Stochastic Games* (POSGs) and the details are similar to [RLLib's MultiAgent environment specification](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib-env.html#multi-agent-and-hierarchical), except we allow for different observation and action spaces between the agents.

### Example Usage

Environments can be interacted with as follows:

``` python
parallel_env = pistonball_v1.parallel_env()
observations = parallel_env.reset()
max_cycles = 500
for step in range(max_cycles):
    actions = {agent: policy(observations[agent], agent) for agent in parallel_env.agents}
    observations, rewards, dones, infos = parallel_env.step(actions)
```

### Full API

`agents`, `num_agents`, `possible_agents`, `max_num_agents`, `observation_spaces`, and `action_spaces` attributes are available and are as described above in the main API description.

`render(mode='human')`, `seed(seed=None)`, `close()` are methods as described above in the main API description.

`step(actions)`: receives a dictionary of actions keyed by the agent name. Returns the observation dictionary, reward dictionary, done dictionary, and info dictionary, where each dictionary is keyed by the agent.

`reset()`: resets the environment and returns a dictionary of observations (keyed by the agent name)

## SuperSuit

[SuperSuit](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/SuperSuit) contains nice wrappers to do common preprocessing actions, like frame stacking or changing RGB observations to greyscale. It also supports Gym environments, in addition to PettingZoo.


## Utils

PettingZoo has some utilities to help make simple interactions with the environment trivial to implement. Utilities which are designed to help make environments easier to develop are in the developer documentation.

### Average Total Reward Util

The average total reward for an environment, as presented in the documentation, is summed over all agents over all steps in the episode, averaged over episodes.

This value is important for establishing the simplest possible baseline: the random policy.

``` python
from pettingzoo.utils import average_total_reward
from pettingzoo.butterfly import pistonball_v6
env = pistonball_v6.env()
average_total_reward(env, max_episodes=100, max_steps=10000000000)
```

Where `max_episodes` and `max_steps` both limit the total number of evaluations (when the first is hit evaluation stops)

### Manual Control

Often, you want to be able to play before trying to learn it to get a better feel for it. Some of our games directly support this:

``` python
from pettingzoo.butterfly knights_archers_zombies_v10
knights_archers_zombies_v10.manual_control(<environment parameters>)
```

Environments say if they support this functionality in their documentation, and what the specific controls are.

### Random Demo

You can also easily get a quick impression of them by watching a random policy control all the actions:

``` python
from pettingzoo.utils import random_demo
random_demo(env, render=True, episodes=1)
```

### Playing Alongside Trained Policies

Sometimes, you may want to control a singular agent and let the other agents be controlled by trained policies.
Some games support this via:

``` python
import time
from pettingzoo.butterfly import knights_archers_zombies_v10

env = knights_archers_zombies_v10.env()
env.reset()

manual_policy = knights_archers_zombies_v10.ManualPolicy(env)

for agent in env.agent_iter():
    observation, reward, done, info = env.last()

    if agent == manual_policy.agent:
        action = manual_policy(observation, agent)
    else:
        action = policy(observation, agent)

    env.step(action)

    env.render()
    time.sleep(0.05)

    if done:
        env.reset()
```

`ManualPolicy` accepts several default arguments:

`agent_id`: Accepts an integer for the agent in the environment that will be controlled via the keyboard. Use `manual_policy.availabla_agents` to query what agents are available and what are their indices.

`show_obs`: Is a boolean which shows the observation from the currently selected agent, if available.

### Observation Saving

If the agents in a game make observations that are images then the observations can be saved to an image file. This function takes in the environment, along with a specified agent. If no `agent` is specified, then the current selected agent for the environment is chosen. If `all_agents` is passed in as `True`, then the observations of all agents in the environment is saved. By default, the images are saved to the current working directory in a folder matching the environment name. The saved image will match the name of the observing agent. If `save_dir` is passed in, a new folder is created where images will be saved to. This function can be called during training/evaluation if desired, which is why environments have to be reset before it can be used.

``` python
from pettingzoo.utils import save_observation
from pettingzoo.butterfly import pistonball_v6
env = pistonball_v6.env()
env.reset()
save_observation(env, agent=None, all_agents=False, save_dir=os.getcwd())
```
