# API

## Initializing Environments

Using environments in PettingZoo is very similar to Gym, i.e. you initialize an environment via:

```
from pettingzoo.butterfly import pistonball_v0
env = pistonball_v0.env()
```

Environments are generally highly configurable via arguments at creation, i.e.:

```
cooperative_pong.env(ball_speed=18, left_paddle_speed=25,
right_paddle_speed=25, is_cake_paddle=True, max_frames=900, bounce_randomness=False)
```

## Interacting With Environments

Environments can be interacted with in a manner very similar to Gym:

```
observation = env.reset()
for agent in env.agent_iter():
    reward, done, info = env.last()
    action = policy(observation)
    observation = env.step(action)
```

The commonly used methods are:

`agent_iter(max_agent_iter=2**63)` returns an iterator that yields the current agent of the environment. It terminates when all agents in the environment are done or when `max_agent_iter` (steps have been executed).

`last()` returns the total reward the agent has received since it's last step and present, if the agent is done, anything in info associated with the selected agent. Note that a particular agent being done does not mean the environment is over!

`reset(observe=True)` resets the environment (and sets it up for use when called the first time), and returns the observation of the first agent in `agent order`. Setting `observe=False` disables computing and returning the observation.

`step(action, observe=True)` takes the action of the agent in the environment, automatically switches control to the next agent, and *returns the observation for the next agent* (as it's what the policy will next need). Setting `observe=False` disables computing and returning the observation.


## Additional Environment API

PettingZoo models games as AEC games, and thus can support any game multi-agent RL can consider, allowing for fantastically weird cases. Because of this, our API includes lower level functions and attributes that you probably won't need, but are very important when you do. Their functionality is also needed by the high level functions above though, so implementing them is just a matter of code factoring.

`agents`: A list of the names of all current agents, typically integers. These may be changed as an environment progresses (i.e. agents can be added or removed).

`agent_selection` an attribute of the environment corresponding to the currently selected agent that an action can be taken for. Internal functions use it to know what agent is acting.

`num_agents`: The number of agents currently in the environment.

`observation_spaces`: A dict of the gym observation spaces of every agent, by name.

`action_spaces`: A dict of the gym action spaces of every agent, by name.

`rewards`: A dict of the rewards of every agent at the time called, by name. Rewards are summed from the last time an agent took it's turn, and zeroed before it takes another turn. This is accessed by `last`. This looks like:

`{0:[first agent's reward], 1:[second agent's reward] ... n-1:[nth agent's reward]}`

`dones`: A dict of the done state of every agent at the time called, by name. This is accessed by `last`. This looks like:

`dones = {0:[first agent's done state], 1:[second agent's done state] ... n-1:[nth agent's done state]}`

`infos`: A dict of info for each agent, by name. Each agent's info is also a dict. This is accessed by `last`. This looks like:

`infos = {0:[first agent's info], 1:[second agent's info] ... n-1:[nth agent's info]}`

`observe(agent)`: Returns the observation an agent currently can make. `step` calls this.

`render(mode='human')`: Displays a rendered frame from the environment, if supported. Environments may support different render modes.

`close()`: Closes the rendering window.

## Environment Actions

In this API when the environment acts following an agents action they're treated as happening at the same time. There are cases where breaking these apart can be very helpful. Our API supports this by treating the environment as an "agent". While initially odd, having an environment agent that can act on the state of the game is actually a common modeling practice in game theory.

We encourage calling the environment actor `'env'` in `env.agents`, and having it take `None` as an action.

## Raw Environments

All environments end in something like \_v0.  When changes are made to environments that might impact learning results, the number is increased by one to prevent potential confusion.

Environments are by default wrapped in a handful of lightweight wrappers that handle error messages and reasonable behaviors with incorrect usage (such as playing illegal moves or stepping before resetting). However, these add a very small amount of overhead. If you want to create an environment without them, you can do so by using the raw_env constructor contained within each module:

```
env = prospector_v0.raw_env(<environment parameters>)
```

## SuperSuit

[SuperSuit](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/SuperSuit) contains nice wrappers to do common preprocessing actions, like frame stacking or changing RGB observations to greyscale. It also supports Gym environments, in addition to PettingZoo.

## Utils

### API Test

```
import pettingzoo.tests.api_test as api_test
api_test.api_test(env, render=False, verbose_progress=False)
```

This tests the environment for API compliance. If the environment has a custom `render()` method, setting argument `render=True` tests whether there is an accompanying custom `close()` method. If `verbose_progress=True`, progress of the test is printed to the console.

### Bombardment Test

```
import pettingzoo.tests.bombardment_test as bombardment_test
bombardment_test.bombardment_test(env, cycles=10000)
```

This randomly plays through the environment `cycles` times, to test for stability.

### Performance Benchmark

```
import pettingzoo.tests.performance_benchmark as performance_benchmark
performance_benchmark.performance_benchmark(env)
```

This randomly steps through the environment for 60 seconds to benchmark it's performance.

### Manual Control Test

```
import pettingzoo.tests.manual_control_test as manual_control_test
manual_control_test.test_manual_control(env.manual_control)
```

If the environment has `manual_control` functionality included (explained below), this test makes sure the method does not creash for random key inputs. The argument supplied to the `test_manual_control` method is the manual control method name for the environment (i.e. `manual_control=pistonball.manual_control`).

### Manual Control

Often, you want to be able to play before trying to learn it to get a better feel for it. Some of our games directly support this:

```
from pettingzoo.butterfly import prison_v1
prison_v1.manual_control(<environment parameters>)
```

Environemnts say if they support this functionality in their documentation, and what the specific controls are.

### Random Demo

For all renderable games, including those that can't be played by humans, you easily can get an impression for them by watching a random policy control all the actions:

```
from pettingzoo.utils import random_demo
random_demo(env)
```

### Observation Saving

If the agents in a game make observations that are images then the observations can be saved to an image file. This function takes in the environment, along with a specified agent. If no agent is specified then the current selected agent for the environment is chosen. If all_agents is passed in as True, then the observations of all agents in the environment is saved. By default the images are saved to the current working directory in a folder matching the environment name. The saved image will match the name of the observing agent. If save_dir is passed in, a new folder is created where images will be saved to.

```
from pettingzoo.utils import save_observation
save_observation(env, agent=None, all_agents=False, save_dir=os.getcwd())

```

The first function will save the current observation for the specified agent. The second function will save the current observation based on the currently selected agent. The last function will save the current observations of all agents in the environment.
