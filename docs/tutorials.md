An example-based introduction to the PettingZoo API for beginners, that then shows users how to use tabular Q Learning for self play in the Tic Tac Toe environment.

## Learning in PettingZoo Environments with RLlib
[Draft] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URk_30risCDf5XzQ11IX5k_CddXcEAKa-ZfFnja8Ysw/edit?usp=sharing

An in-depth tutorial on using RLlib for environments with PettingZoo, specifically covering Pistonball and Leduc Hold'em (which covers turn based games with action masking).

This tutorials is a draft that should be complete by the end of September; improved Pistonball code and Ledum Hold'em code that has not made it into the main tutorial are available in
