"""
In this environment, there are 2 good agents (Alice and Bob) and 1 adversary (Eve). Alice must sent a private 1 bit message to Bob over a public channel. Alice and Bob are rewarded +2 if Bob reconstructs the message, but are rewarded -2 if Eve reconstruct the message (that adds to 0 if both teams reconstruct the bit). Eve is rewarded -2 based if it cannot reconstruct the signal, zero if it can. Alice and Bob have a private key (randomly generated at beginning of each episode) which they must learn to use to encrypt the message.

Alice observation space: `[message, private_key]`

Bob observation space: `[private_key, alices_comm]`

Eve observation space: `[alices_comm]`

Alice action space: `[say_0, say_1, say_2, say_3]`

Bob action space: `[say_0, say_1, say_2, say_3]`

Eve action space: `[say_0, say_1, say_2, say_3]`

For Bob and Eve, their communication is checked to be the 1 bit of information that Alice is trying to convey.

### Arguments

`max_cycles`:  number of frames (a step for each agent) until game terminates

`continuous_actions`: Whether agent action spaces are discrete(default) or continuous
