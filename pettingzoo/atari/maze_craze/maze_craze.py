A competitive game of memory and planning!

Its a race to leave the maze. There are 3 main versions of the game.

1. **Race**: A basic version of the game. First to leave the maze wins
2. **Robbers**: There are 2 robbers randomly traversing the maze. If you are captured by the robbers, you lose the game, and receive -1 reward, and will be done. The player that has not been captured will not receive any reward, but they can still exit the maze and win, scoring +1 reward.
3. **Capture**: Each player have to capture all 3 robbers before you are able to exit the maze. Additionally, you can confuse your opponent (and yourself, if you are not careful!) by creating a block that looks identical to a wall in the maze, but all players can pass through it. You can only
create one wall at a time, when you create a new one, the old one disappears.

The first player to leave the maze scores +1, the other player scores -1 (unless that other player has already been captured in Robbers mode).

[Official Maze craze manual](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=295). Note that the table of modes has some inaccuracies. In particular, game mode 12 has Blockade enabled, not mode 11.

#### Environment parameters

Some environment parameters are common to all Atari environments and are described in the [base Atari documentation](../atari).

Parameters specific to Maze Craze are

``` python
maze_craze.env(game_version="robbers", visibilty_level=0)
```

`game_version`:  Possibilities are "robbers", "race", "capture", corresponding to the 3 game versions described above

`visibilty_level`:  A number from 0-3. Set to 0 for 100% visible map, and 3 for 0% visibility map.

### Action Space

In any given turn, an agent can choose from one of 18 actions.

| Action    | Behavior  |

| 0         | No operation |
